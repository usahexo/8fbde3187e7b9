      		<h1 id="Nevada-Regulators-Approve-Dozens-of-Gambling-Claims"><a href="#Nevada-Regulators-Approve-Dozens-of-Gambling-Claims" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Regulators Approve Dozens of Gambling Claims"></a>Nevada Regulators Approve Dozens of Gambling Claims</h1><p>On Tuesday, Nevada regulators announced that they had approved dozens of claims for gambling losses. This is the first time that the state has processed such claims since a new law went into effect in October that allows people to file for compensation if they suffer losses because of cheating or fraud by a casino.</p>
<p>The new law was enacted in response to the scandal at the now-defunct online poker site, Absolute Poker, which allowed its customers to cheat other players. In total, the state has approved over $1 million in claims so far, with more expected to be filed in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Most of the approved claimants have been residents of Nevada, though a few out-of-state gamblers have also received payments. The largest individual payment was $75,000, while the vast majority of payments were for much smaller amounts.</p>
<p>State officials say that they are still working on developing a system for processing claims, and that more information about how to file a claim will be released in the coming weeks. They added that anyone who believes they may have been a victim of cheating or fraud at a casino should file a claim as soon as possible.</p>
<h1 id="Third-Party-Gambling-Claims-Upheld-in-UK-Court"><a href="#Third-Party-Gambling-Claims-Upheld-in-UK-Court" class="headerlink" title="Third Party Gambling Claims Upheld in UK Court"></a>Third Party Gambling Claims Upheld in UK Court</h1><p>The UK Court of Appeal has ruled in favor of third party gambling claims, meaning that bookmakers could be liable for losses incurred by gamblers outside of their establishments.</p>
<p>This landmark ruling is a victory for those who have campaigned for years to hold the gambling industry accountable for the social and financial harms caused by problem gambling.</p>
<p>Lord Justice Singh, one of the three judges who delivered the unanimous verdict, said that “the protecting and regulating functions of licensing are not confined to those who are on the premises.”</p>
<p>“It is also necessary to recognize the fact that people can become addicted to gambling, sometimes through no fault of their own, and that they may incur significant financial losses as a result,” he added.</p>
<p>Gambling companies have long argued that they should not be held liable for losses incurred by people who gamble away money at home or abroad. But now, thanks to this new ruling, they could be on the hook for millions of pounds in damages.</p>
<p>This is a huge win for problem gamblers and their families, who have often been left struggling to cope with the aftermath of addiction. It is also a major step forward in holding the gambling industry accountable for the damage it causes.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-Casino-Sues-Insurance-Company-Over-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Casino-Sues-Insurance-Company-Over-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Casino Sues Insurance Company Over Gambling Losses"></a>Atlantic City Casino Sues Insurance Company Over Gambling Losses</h1><p>The Atlantic City casino has filed a lawsuit claiming that its insurance company refused to pay out $1.5 million in gambling losses.</p>
<p>The casino, which is unnamed in the lawsuit, claims that it had an insurance policy with the company that would cover losses up to $1.5 million. The casino alleges that it lost more than that amount while gambling at the casino, and that the insurance company has refused to pay out.</p>
<p>The casino is seeking damages in excess of $1.5 million, as well as interest and attorney fees.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino has sued an insurance company over gambling losses. In 2007, the Foxwoods Resort Casino sued its insurance company after losing more than $7 million while gambling.</p>
<p>Gambling is a risky proposition, and casinos are often unwilling to shoulder the entire burden of those risks. That’s why casinos often purchase insurance policies to protect themselves from large losses.</p>
<p>In this case, it appears that the casino had a policy in place with an insurance company, but that the company refused to pay out after the casino incurred significant losses. It will be interesting to see how this case plays out in court.</p>
<h1 id="California-Tribe-Plans-Gambling-Resort-Near-Las-Vegas"><a href="#California-Tribe-Plans-Gambling-Resort-Near-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="California Tribe Plans Gambling Resort Near Las Vegas"></a>California Tribe Plans Gambling Resort Near Las Vegas</h1><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p>The Enterprise report that a Native American tribe in California is planning to build a massive gambling resort near Las Vegas. The Paiute tribe, which is based in the state’s northeast corner, is hoping to open the $7 billion project as early as 2020. If completed, it would be one of the largest resorts in the world.</p>
<p>The proposal still needs to be approved by the federal government, but the tribe is optimistic that it will get the green light. They are currently in negotiations with several casino companies about operating the resort, and they hope to break ground within the next year.</p>
<p>The proposed resort would include a casino, hotel, restaurants, and other entertainment venues. It would be built on tribal land near the town of Primm, Nevada, which is just minutes from the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>This would not be the first time that Native Americans have operated a gambling resort near Las Vegas. The Mohegan and Pequot tribes both have casinos in Connecticut that are popular tourist destinations. The Mohegan Sun Casino is one of the largest in North America, and it attracted more than 9 million visitors last year.</p>
<p>The Paiute tribe is hoping for similar success with their new resort. They believe that it will create jobs and generate revenue for their community. And they hope that it will help to revive Nevada’s struggling economy.</p>
<h1 id="MGM-Seeks-To-Stop-Connecticut-Casino-From-Offering-Gambling"><a href="#MGM-Seeks-To-Stop-Connecticut-Casino-From-Offering-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="MGM Seeks To Stop Connecticut Casino From Offering Gambling"></a>MGM Seeks To Stop Connecticut Casino From Offering Gambling</h1><p>MGM Resorts International has gone to court in an attempt to stop the new Connecticut casino from opening up its gambling floor.</p>
<p>The planned $1 billion Foxwoods Resort Casino is scheduled to open in early 2019, and MGM is arguing that the new venue would have a harmful impact on its existing casino in nearby Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>MGM’s lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that the new Connecticut casino would violate a 1992 agreement between the two states which restricts competition between the casinos.</p>
<p>Foxwoods Resort Casino has responded by stating that it plans to offer only “minimal gambling” and that its primary focus will be on its hotel, spa, and other non-gambling amenities.</p>
<p>The controversy over the new casino comes as MGM ramps up its own expansion plans, with projects currently underway or planned in Maryland, Massachusetts, and National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland.</p>
<p>The company has argued that its expanding footprint is necessary to compete with larger casinos operated by rivals such as Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts.</p>
