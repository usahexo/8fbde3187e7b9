It is owned and operated by the Gentry family, who also own and operate the Gentry’s Down Under restaurant in Grand Prairie.</p>
<p>The casino has been in business since May of 2016 and is located at 2001 E. Main Street in Grand Prairie. It features 10 live table games, a full service bar, and complimentary snacks.</p>
<p>The Gentry family has been in the casino business since 1978, when they opened their first casino in Fort Worth. They currently own and operate five casinos in Texas.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-Texas-Rangers"><a href="#Who-are-the-Texas-Rangers" class="headerlink" title="Who are the Texas Rangers?"></a>Who are the Texas Rangers?</h1><p>The Texas Rangers are an American professional baseball team based in Arlington, Texas. The Rangers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West division. Since 1994, they have played at Globe Life Park in Arlington. The team’s name is borrowed from the famous law enforcement agency of the same name.</p>
<p>The franchise was established in 1961 as the Washington Senators, an expansion team awarded to Washington, D.C., after the city’s original AL franchise, the Washington Nationals, relocated to Minneapolis-St. Paul and became the Minnesota Twins. After two seasons in Washington, the team moved south to become the Texas Rangers.</p>
<p>The Rangers have won two American League pennants and three Division titles. The franchise has also been home to some of the game’s greatest players, including Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan, Lee Trevino, Buddy Bell, Rubén Sierra, Iván Rodríguez, Michael Young, and Adrian Beltre.</p>
<h1 id="Origins-of-the-franchise"><a href="#Origins-of-the-franchise" class="headerlink" title="Origins of the franchise"></a>Origins of the franchise</h1><p>In 1959, Bud Selig led a group of eight investors who bought the Milwaukee Brewers from Joseph Llewellyn for $2 million. Selig became Chairman of the Board for the Brewers and owned a controlling interest in the club.[7] He eventually became Commissioner of Baseball. At one point, Selig threatened to move the Brewers to Seattle unless a new stadium was built.[8]<br>In 1960, as part of Major League Baseball’s expansion plans, teams were awarded to Dallas–Fort Worth (the Texas Rangers) and Washington, D.C. (the Washington Senators). The first game in Arlington was played on April 15 against California Angels rookie phenom Bo Belinsky.[9] After two seasons in Washington as tenants of Griffith Stadium under manager Ted Williams,[10] owner Bob Short moved the team to Arlington for economic reasons after his lease ran out and fans abandoned D.C.’s decrepit ballpark en masse.[11][12][13][14] </p>
<h1 id="A-losing-start-in-Arlington"><a href="#A-losing-start-in-Arlington" class="headerlink" title="A losing start in Arlington"></a>A losing start in Arlington</h1><p>After moving from Washington to Arlington prior to the 1971 season,[15][16] things did not go well for Short’s Cowboys Stadium successor quickly nicknamed “The Bingo Palace” by area sportswriters: attendance plummeted from 1.8 million during their final season in D.C., when they ranked ninth out of 10 teams in MLB,[17]to 685 thousand their first year in Texas—ranking last out of 14 teams;[18] while losses mounted to $1 million per month on average.[19][20][21][22][failed verification] In 1972–73 it cost an average of just over $18 a fan to see a game at Arlington Stadium;[19] by contrast it cost less than half that ($9) to see a game at Fenway Park that year.[fail verification requested] In December 1974 Short sold both teams for a total price tag reported at between $10 million and $12 million;[21][23][13](purchased by Red McCombs), marking MLB’s first ever billion-dollar transaction.[24][25]) By 1979 he had repurchased both teams but retained control only of the Rangers whom he moved from Arlington Stadium into The Ballpark In Arlington which he built for them (and then leased back).[4]:146</p>
<h1 id="What-did-Thoreau-write"><a href="#What-did-Thoreau-write" class="headerlink" title="What did Thoreau write?"></a>What did Thoreau write?</h1><p>Henry David Thoreau is most famous for writing the book Walden, about his time living in a cabin near Walden Pond. However, he wrote many other essays and books over his lifetime.</p>
<p>Some of Thoreau’s most famous essays include “Civil Disobedience” and “Life without Principle”. In “Civil Disobedience”, Thoreau argues that people should not always obey the law, even if it goes against their personal beliefs. He believes that people have a duty to speak out against injustice, even if it means breaking the law.</p>
<p>In “Life without Principle”, Thoreau argues that people often lead boring lives because they are too focused on making money. He encourages people to pursue more meaningful pursuits, such as art, nature, and philosophy.</p>
<h1 id="When-did-he-write-it"><a href="#When-did-he-write-it" class="headerlink" title="When did he write it?"></a>When did he write it?</h1><p> Schubert wrote the  String Quintet in C major, D. 956 on November 29, 1828.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-history-behind-the-work"><a href="#What-is-the-history-behind-the-work" class="headerlink" title="What is the history behind the work?"></a>What is the history behind the work?</h1><p>There is little documented history about the writing of the String Quintet in C major, D. 956. However, what is known is that it was written in a very short period of time and is one of Schubert’s most celebrated chamber works.</p>
<p>The String Quintet in C major was likely commissioned by Ignaz Schuppanzigh, a well-known violinist and close friend of Schubert’s. It is believed that Schuppanzigh himself may have played the first performance of the work on January 23, 1829 with his string quartet.</p>
<p>Since its premiere, the String Quintet in C major has been widely acclaimed by critics and audiences alike. It has been recorded many times and is a popular piece for concerts and recitals.</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-it-important"><a href="#Why-is-it-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is it important?"></a>Why is it important?</h1><p>A well-functioning democracy is a cornerstone of any healthy society. It enables citizens to come together and make decisions about how they want to be governed, and holds leaders accountable to the people. However, in many countries around the world, democracy is not working as well as it should. This can be for a variety of reasons, including corruption, lack of participation, or an unfair voting system.</p>
<p>One way to help ensure that democracy is working effectively is to measure how well it is serving the people. This can be done using tools like the Democracy Index, which ranks countries according to their level of democracy. While this index is a good starting point, it is important to remember that it is not perfect, and that there are many different ways to measure democracy.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-components-of-a-healthy-democracy"><a href="#What-are-the-components-of-a-healthy-democracy" class="headerlink" title="What are the components of a healthy democracy?"></a>What are the components of a healthy democracy?</h1><p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the health of democracies varies from country to country. However, there are some key components that are generally seen as important in a healthy democracy. These include free and fair elections, freedom of speech and assembly, freedom of the press, respect for human rights, and equality before the law.</p>
<h1 id="How-is-democracy-measured"><a href="#How-is-democracy-measured" class="headerlink" title="How is democracy measured?"></a>How is democracy measured?</h1><p>There are a number of different ways to measure democracy, including surveys of citizens’ opinions on various aspects of governance, indices that rank countries according to their level of democracy, and measurements of political and civil rights. While each method has its strengths and limitations, they can all provide valuable insights into how well a country’s democracy is functioning.</p>
<h1 id="What-factors-affect-democracy"><a href="#What-factors-affect-democracy" class="headerlink" title="What factors affect democracy?"></a>What factors affect democracy?</h1><p>There are many factors that can affect the health of a democracy. These include but are not limited to: levels of corruption; extent of political participation; degree of freedom enjoyed by citizens; quality of elections; presence or absence of social justice; and extent of media freedom. Each country will have its own unique set of factors that impact its democracy.</p>
