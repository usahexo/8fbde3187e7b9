#  Brewers Destroy Astros 13-5 to Take Series

The Milwaukee Brewers seemingly couldn't be stopped in their game 3 matchup against the Houston Astros, blowing out the defending champs 13-5.

Christian Yelich led the way for Milwaukee, going 4 for 5 with a home run and four RBI. Ryan Braun and Mike Moustakas also had big games, driving in three runs apiece.

Brewers starter Jhoulys Chacin was solid, allowing only two runs over six innings of work. Jeremy Jeffress and Josh Hader combined to finish off the game, allowing three runs over the final three innings.

The Brewers will now look to take the series in game 4 on Wednesday night. Brandon Woodruff is scheduled to start for Milwaukee while Justin Verlander will take the mound for Houston.

#  Braun, Thames Power Brewers Past Astros

In Game 1 of the ALDS, the Brewers traveled to Houston to take on the defending World Series Champions, the Astros. The Brewers were led by their MVP candidate, Christian Yelich, and their dominant bullpen. The Astros were led by Justin Verlander and their vaunted offense.

The game was a pitcher’s duel early. Neither team could get on the board until the 4th inning, when the Brewers took a 2-0 lead. Braun came up with runners on first and second with one out and hit a two-run double to put the Brewers up. Thames followed that up with a homer to left field to make it 4-0 Milwaukee.

Verlander was pulled after that inning, and Ryan Pressly came in to try and stop the Brewers’ momentum. It didn’t work. In the 5th inning, Keon Broxton singled home Mike Moustakas to make it 5-0 Milwaukee.

Houston got on the board in the bottom of the 5th when Tony Kemp hit a solo homer off of Josh Hader, but that was as close as they would get. Hader would strike out six batters in three innings to secure the victory for Milwaukee.

Brewers starters Zach Davies and Jhoulys Chacin pitched well, but it was Milwaukee’s bullpen that stole the show. Jeremy Jeffress, Joakim Soria, Corey Knebel and Hader combined to pitch six innings of no-hit ball while striking out 11 batters.

The Brewers will now head to Milwaukee with a 1-0 lead in the series. They will look to take control of the series on Friday night when they send Gio Gonzalez to the mound against Dallas Keuchel.

#  Shaw Homers Twice as Brewers Top Astros

It was a good night at the ballpark for Christian Yelich and the Milwaukee Brewers.

Yelich got things going with a two-run homer in the first inning off Astros starter Gerrit Cole, and Shaw added to the lead with a solo shot in the third.

Shaw then put the game out of reach with another homer in the eighth, giving him three on the night and his team a 9-4 victory.

"I feel like I've been seeing the ball well lately," Shaw said. "I just wanted to stay aggressive and not try to do too much."

Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin was solid through six innings, allowing four runs - all earned - on six hits while striking out six. Jeremy Jeffress (1-0) got the win thanks to 1 2/3 innings of scoreless relief.

Cole (1-2) took the loss, giving up seven runs - six earned - on eight hits in four innings. He also struck out six batters but walked four.

"I think it wasjust one of those days," Cole said of his outing. "Command wasn't quite there early, and they made me pay for it."

The Brewers (10-5) have now won five straight games while Houston (7-8) has lost four in a row.

#  Counsell Gets 800th Win in Brewers' Victory Over Astros

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Counsell Gets 800th Win in Brewers' Victory Over Astros

Craig Counsell became the sixth major league manager to win 800 games with the same team, and Christian Yelich hit his NL-leading 22nd homer in the Milwaukee Brewers' 6-3 victory over the Houston Astros on Tuesday night.

Counsell, in his fifth season at Milwaukee's helm, joined Bobby Cox, Tony La Russa, Lou Piniella, Joe Torre and Dusty Baker as managers who have won at least 800 games with one club.

"It's a nice number. I'm happy for it," Counsell said. "But really it means I've been around for a while here. That's what it means more than anything."

Yelich connected off starter Gerrit Cole (9-5) in the third inning for his NL-leading 22nd home run . Ryan Braun hit his 14th homer and Jesus Aguilar his 21st for Milwaukee.

"What he's doing is unfathomable," Braun said of Yelich. "It seems like every single day he does something else special."

Josh Hader pitched two innings of scoreless relief for his sixth save. He has not allowed an earned run in 30 appearances this season, extending his MLB record to 43 1/3 innings without giving up an earned run.

#  Yelich, Guerra Lead Brewers Over Astros

Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich and starting pitcher Junior Guerra led the team to a 4-0 victory over the Houston Astros on Tuesday night.

Yelich went 3 for 4 at the plate and drove in two runs, while Guerra threw seven scoreless innings, allowing just four hits and one walk.

It was Guerra’s third start of the season and his first win, and he said it felt good to finally get a victory under his belt.

“I was happy with the way I pitched tonight,” Guerra said. “I was able to keep them off balance and get some key strikeouts when I needed them.”

Brewers manager Craig Counsell was also pleased with Guerra’s performance.

“Junior was really good tonight,” Counsell said. “He attacked hitters, limited damage, and gave us a chance to win. That’s all you can ask for from your starter.”

The Brewers got on the board in the third inning, when Yelich hit an RBI double off Astros starter Justin Verlander. They added to their lead in the fifth inning, when Yelich hit an RBI single off reliever Will Harris.

Milwaukee tacked on two more runs in the seventh inning, when Jesus Aguilar hit a two-run homer off Verlander. It was Aguilar’s fourth home run of the season.

With the victory, the Brewers improve to 6-1 on the season while the Astros drop to 5-2.
