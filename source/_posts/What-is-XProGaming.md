#  How do you play Live Casino House baccarat?

Baccarat is a simple card game that can be learned quite easily and it’s one of the most popular casino games in the world. The game is played with six decks of 52 cards, and there are two hands dealt to each player - the banker and the player. The aim of the game is to get as close as possible to nine points with your two cards.

The first step is to decide who will be playing as the banker. In some casinos, the banker is automatically assigned, but in others, you can choose who bankrolls the game by bidding. The player then bets on either Banker or Player, and two cards are dealt face-up to both players.

The point value of each card is calculated using this simple formula: number on card / 10 + number on card. So an Ace would be 1 point, a 2 would be 2 points, and so on. If one of your cards has a value of ten (10, J, Q, K), then only the other number on that card is counted. So for example if you were dealt an 8 and a King (8 / 10 + 4), your total points would be six points.

The person with the highest total points at the end of the hand wins - either the Banker or the Player - and their bet is paid out accordingly. If both players have exactly the same total, then it’s called a ‘push’ and no one wins or loses money.
