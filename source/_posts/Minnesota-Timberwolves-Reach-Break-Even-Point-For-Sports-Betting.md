#  Minnesota Timberwolves Reach Break Even Point For Sports Betting

The Minnesota Timberwolves have only gone 5-10 against the spread in their last 15 games, but they finally reached break even point for sports betting on Wednesday night. The Timberwolves beat the Memphis Grizzlies 112-99 as a 2.5-point home underdog, improving to 50-50 ATS on the season. Minnesota is now 3-3 ATS in its last six games and heads into its matchup with the Houston Rockets as a 5.5-point underdog on Friday night.

Jimmy Butler led the way for Minnesota with 27 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, while Karl-Anthony Towns chipped in with 25 points and 10 rebounds. Andrew Wiggins struggled offensively, finishing with just 10 points on 4-of-15 shooting, but he made up for it with six rebounds, four assists and three steals. Jeff Teague also played well off the bench, scoring 18 points on 7-of-12 shooting.

The Rockets come into this matchup averaging 113.7 points per game while shooting 47.1 percent from the field and 38 percent from three-point range. They’ve been even better over their last five games, averaging 132 points per game while shooting 52 percent from the field and 41 percent from three-point range. The Timberwolves will need to play much better defensively if they want to keep this game close.

#  Timberwolves' Sports Betting Success Continues With Break Even Percentage

The Minnesota Timberwolves continue to prove their worth in the sports betting world with a break even percentage on the year. The team is currently sitting at an even 41-41 record, putting them in playoff contention as the seventh seed in the Western Conference.

One of the biggest reasons for the Timberwolves' success this year has been their defense. They are currently ranked fourth in the NBA for defensive rating, allowing just 105 points per game. This has been led by All-Star center Karl Anthony-Towns, who is averaging 2.2 blocks and 1.3 steals per game this season.

Along with Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Jimmy Butler have also been playing well this season. Wiggins is averaging 23 points per game while Butler is averaging 19 points per game. If they can continue to play at this level, the Timberwolves should be able to make a deep run in the playoffs.

The Timberwolves will have their work cut out for them in the playoffs, as they will be facing off against some of the best teams in the NBA. However, if they can continue to play like they have been all year, there is no reason why they can't come out on top.

#  Minnesota Timberwolves Achieve Break Even Point In Sports Betting 

The Minnesota Timberwolves have managed to achieve break even point in sports betting, according to reports from ESPN. The Timberwolves had been on a bit of a losing streak but they seem to have turned things around as they managed to get a break even result in their latest game.

This is good news for the Timberwolves organization and their fans, as it means that they can continue to place bets and make money off of their games. It also indicates that the Timberwolves are becoming more competitive and could potentially make it into the playoffs this season.

It has been a longtime goal of the Timberwolves organization to become one of the top teams in the NBA, and it looks like they may be finally making some progress. The team has some very talented players, including Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, who are both potential stars in the league.

With continued development and support from their fans, the Timberwolves could make a real run at the playoffs this season. There is still a lot of basketball left to be played, so anything is possible, but it looks like Minnesota is headed in the right direction.

#  NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves Reach Break Even Percentage In Sports Betting

The Minnesota Timberwolves have now reached break even percentage in sports betting, according to a report from ESPN. The Wolves were at one point down 10-plus games against the spread but they have since bounced back and are now at 50.2 percent ATS (against the spread).

The turnaround began on January 15th when they covered a 2.5-point spread against the Oklahoma City Thunder as slight underdogs. They’ve since gone 7-7 ATS, including a stretch of four consecutive covers. All four of those games came as underdogs of 3.5 points or more, which is something that hasn’t been done in the NBA since the 2014-15 season, per ESPN Stats and Information Group.

Tom Thibodeau has been known for his defensive mindsets during his time as a head coach in the NBA, and it looks like he’s starting to rub off on this Timberwolves team. They’re currently ranked second in the league in defensive rating (101.9) after finishing last season ranked 25th (109.3).

Karl-Anthony Towns has largely been responsible for this turnaround on defense. According to Second Spectrum tracking data, Towns switches onto an opponent 65 percent of the time when he’s near the paint — up from 33 percent last season. That helps to keep opponents guessing and minimizes mismatches on defense.

Andrew Wiggins has also taken a step forward this season. He ranks ninth in ESPN’s real plus-minus (2.54), which measures how well each player contributes net points per 100 possessions while on the court relative to a league-average player Base +/- is adjusted for teammates, opponents and other factors). This offseason he signed a five-year extension worth $148 million, so it will be interesting to see if he can keep up this level of play throughout the duration of that contract.
