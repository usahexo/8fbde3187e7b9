#  21-Year Anniversary of U.S. Invasion of Nicaragua

This week marks the 21-year anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Nicaragua. The United States has a long and bloody history of meddling in the affairs of Latin American countries, with devastating consequences for the people of those countries.

The U.S. invasion of Nicaragua was justified with the false claim that the leftist Sandinista government posed a threat to U.S. security. This was not the case; the Sandinistas were democratically elected and had no intention of attacking the United States.

The U.S. invasion led to the deaths of thousands of Nicaraguans, as well as widespread damage to infrastructure and the economy. The aftermath of the invasion also led to a humanitarian crisis, as tens of thousands of Nicaraguans were forced to flee their homes.

The U.S. invasion of Nicaragua was a blatant act of aggression against a sovereign nation, and it should be condemned by all people who believe in democracy and justice.

#  21st Amendment to the Nicaraguan Constitution Passed

On December 7th, the 21st amendment to the Nicaraguan Constitution was passed in a unanimous vote by the National Assembly. The amendment, proposed by president Daniel Ortega and his wife First Lady Rosario Murillo, creates a new family council headed by the first lady which will have broad powers over government social programs.

The amendment has been widely condemned as a power grab by the Ortega regime, with many accusing Murillo of being a puppetmaster behind her husband's rule. This is not the first time that Ortega has been accused of consolidating power: he has been criticised for his tight control of the media and judiciary, and for his alleged links to drug trafficking and money laundering.

Nonetheless, the amendment passed with near-unanimous support from the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), the party which has controlled Nicaragua since 1979. The FSLN argues that the new family council will help reduce poverty and inequality in Nicaragua, which remains one of Latin America's poorest countries.

#  Halfway to Centenary of Nicaraguan Revolution

Exactly fifty years ago, the first armed insurrection against the Somoza dictatorship broke out. It was a peasant uprising in the department of León, inspired by the Cuban Revolution. From that time on, Nicaragua was convulsed by a series of revolutionary struggles that led to the overthrowing of the Somoza dynasty in 1979 and the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution.

Fifty years later, we are still commemorating that epic struggle and its martyrs. But we are also celebrating all that has been achieved since then: victory over imperialism, nationalization of key sectors of the economy, construction of a new society based on solidarity and social justice.

This year marks an important milestone: halfway to the centenary of the Nicaraguan Revolution. We must build on this momentum to advance even further on the road to socialism.

The challenges we face are many and complex. The imperialists never stop trying to sabotage our progress, using every dirty trick in their playbook: economic sanctions, psychological warfare, manipulation of public opinion. But we have proven ourselves capable of overcoming these difficulties time and again.

Let us continue to march forward with courage and determination, united behind our glorious Sandinista banner!

#  Celebrating 21 Years of Independence in Nicaragua

This year, Nicaragua is celebrating its 21st year of independence. On September 15, 1821, Nicaragua declared its independence from Spain and became a sovereign nation.

Nicaragua is a country with a rich history and culture. It is located in Central America and is bordered by Honduras to the north, Costa Rica to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The country has a population of 6 million people and a GDP of $18.5 billion.

Nicaragua's economy is based on agriculture, which accounts for 24% of GDP, followed by services (21%), manufacturing (20%), and mining (1%). The main crops are coffee, sugarcane, bananas, corn, and rice. The main industries are food processing, textiles and apparel, construction materials, fertilizer, metal products, tourism.

Nicaragua has a diversified economy but faces several challenges including low levels of education and poor infrastructure. 45% of the population lives below the poverty line, and 28% of the population does not have access to safe drinking water.

The government of Nicaragua is working to address these challenges through programmes aimed at increasing education levels and improving infrastructure. The government has also instituted measures to improve transparency and reduce corruption.

Nicaragua is a beautiful country with much to offer tourists. The country has diverse landscapes including mountains, lakes, volcanoes, beaches, and rainforests. There are also many historic sites to visit including churches dating back to the 16th century and museums showcasing Nicaraguan culture.

Nicaragua is an interesting country with a rich history and culture worth exploring. I encourage you to visit this amazing country soon!

#  Nicaraguan President Commemorates 21st Year in Office

On Tuesday, Daniel Ortega, president of Nicaragua, marked the 21st year of his administration. The commemoration was a low-key affair, with few public events.

While there have been some bumps in the road along the way, Ortega’s time in office has been largely successful. He has managed to keep crime rates low and the economy stable. He has also overseen several important social programs that have helped to improve life for ordinary Nicaraguans.

Critics point out that Ortega is an autocrat who has done little to promote democracy and that his government is corrupt. Nonetheless, he remains popular with the majority of Nicaraguans.

Ortega was first elected president in 1984, but he was overthrown by a US-backed military coup two years later. He returned to power in 2007 and has been reelected twice since then.
