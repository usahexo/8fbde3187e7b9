#  Elk Grove Casino to Open for Baccarat in Early 2017

According to the Sacramento Bee, Elk Grove’s Cache Creek Casino Resort will open a new baccarat hall in early 2017. This adds to the Sacramento area's casino offerings, which also include Thunder Valley Casino Resort and Harrah’s Northern California Casino.

The new baccarat hall is part of a $26 million renovation project at Cache Creek, which will also add a new steakhouse and lounge. The renovations are expected to create about 100 jobs.

Cache Creek is owned by the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, which also owns tribes in Northern California and Central California. The tribe has been pushing for a casino in Elk Grove for many years, and finally got approval from the state legislature in 2016.

The new baccarat hall will have 43 tables and should be open in early 2017.

The new Elk Grove casino, set to open in 2020, will feature a 172-room hotel. The $245 million development will also include a spa, two restaurants, and a parking garage.

The casino is a joint venture between the SLS Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip and the Marnell Corrao Associates of Las Vegas. It will be the only casino in the Sacramento area.

“Elk Grove is primed for exponential gaming and hospitality growth,” said Scott Sippola, principal and founder of SLS Hotels & Casinos.

The project still needs approval from the city of Elk Grove, but if all goes according to plan, construction will start in 2019.

#  Elk Grove Casino Will Add 20 Table Games, Including Baccarat

The Elk Grove casino will add 20 table games, including baccarat. The new games will include blackjack, three-card poker, Crazy Eights, and Spanish 21. The new games are expected to be popular with local players.

"The addition of these games is part of our strategy to offer a more complete gaming experience at the casino," said a spokesperson for the casino. "We expect these games to be especially popular with our local players."

The Elk Grove casino is located in the Sacramento area and offers more than 1,000 slot machines and a variety of table games. The new table games are expected to be popular with players in the region.

The Elk Grove casino is owned by the United Auburn Indian Community, which also owns the Thunder Valley Casino Resort.
