On March 7th, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a list of best practices for casino heists. The report, Crime Scoping Guide: Casino Heist, offers an overview of what to avoid when planning and executing a robbery against a casino.

Disrupting gaming operations can be tricky, but the FBI advises would-be thieves to study how slot machines work and identify areas where they can install rigging devices.

The guide also warns intruders to stay away from certain areas, including parking garages and cash rooms. These are typically well-protected and pose a higher risk of getting caught.

Penning a heist movie is no straightforward task. It can be likened to assembling a hundred-piece jigsaw puzzle with an inch-wide picture on the box top. To make your endeavor just a smidge less Herculean, it helps to know what not to put in your film. Sure, there's plenty of leeway when crafting a fictional robbery, but certain elements will only lead to needless frustration on the part of the audience. So what, then, are best left untouched?

For starters, don't get bogged down in the minutiae of the planning stage. The logistics of pulling off a major theft can be interesting fodder for discussion among masterminds, but they tend to bore the average moviegoer senseless. Limit yourself to tight shots of earnest characters poring over blueprints and whispered conversations in dimly lit rooms—the rest can be conveyed by implication.

Similarly, don't spend too much time on the actual heist itself. Unless you're aiming for an all-out action movie, or you're doling out key moments one at a time like Jason Bourne, sequences involving masked gunmen sneaking around and bagging loot can be easily skipped over. Again, let the audience's imagination do most of the heavy lifting; after all, they've probably seen this sort of thing before in one form or another.

What should you include instead? Focus on character development and motivation whenever possible. Heist movies are often as much about who's doing the stealing as they are about what's being stolen. After all, it's hard to get emotionally invested in bags of money or diamonds if we don't care about the people trying to take them home. Give us backstories for at least some of your main players, and show how their individual goals intersect (or conflict) with each other as the plot unfolds.

Another way to keep things engaging is by ramping up the tension as finale approaches. Resist the temptation to wrap everything up tidily with a neat bow; leave some loose ends dangling and drop hints that future complications are inevitable. With luck, this will encourage viewers to talk about your movie long after it's over—and that can only be good for business!

In 2017, the world saw the biggest casino heist in history. Dozens of individuals from all over the world banded together to rob three different casinos in a single night. The total haul was estimated at over $1.5 billion.

However, the success of this robbery relied on one thing: meticulous planning and execution. If one small detail had gone wrong, the whole plan would have fallen apart.

And that’s why scoping out the casino is so important. In this article, we’re going to teach you how to scope away during a casino heist like a pro.

The first step is to determine your target. Not all casinos are created equal – some are much easier to rob than others. The key is to find a casino that’s vulnerable and has low security.

Once you’ve identified your target, it’s time to start planning your attack. This includes figuring out how you’re going to get into the casino, what tools you need, and how you’re going to deal with security personnel.

If you’re not familiar with the layout of the casino, now is the time to do some reconnaissance. Figure out where the security cameras are placed, where the safe is located, and what kind of security guards are on duty.

Once you have all this information, it’s time to put together your game plan. This involves choosing the right moment to strike and making sure everyone is aware of their role in the heist.

If everything goes according to plan, you should be able to rob the casino without any problems. But if something goes wrong, it’s important to have a backup plan in place.

So remember, always scope out your target before attempting a casino heist!

The casino heist is a delicate operation. As with any robbery, the success of the heist hinges on careful planning and execution. Scope is key - you don't want to waste time or resources on anything that isn't critical to the success of the heist. However, there are some things that are best left out of scope. Here are three items to avoid when planning your casino heist:

1) Don't focus on the money - The goal of a casino heist is to steal money, but don't get too fixated on it. If you're too focused on getting the money, you'll miss opportunities to steal other items that could be more valuable, such as chips or jewelry.

2) Don't underestimate security - Security at casinos is usually tight, so don't take it lightly. Make sure you have a plan for dealing with security personnel and cameras.

3) Don't get greedy - One of the biggest causes of casino heists going wrong is greed. Don't try to take too much money or merchandise, or you'll risk getting caught. Stick to the plan and be patient - it will pay off in the end.
