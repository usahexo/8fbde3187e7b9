#  Which Casino Has The Best Free Parking This Summer?

The two casinos in town, the Wynn and the MGM, are both offering free parking this summer. Wynn is offering free self-parking at their three parking garages all summer long, while MGM is giving out free valet parking for up to four hours.

There are a lot of factors to consider when choosing which casino has the best free parking this summer. First, you need to decide if you want to park yourself or have someone else do it for you. If you want to park yourself, MGM has the advantage because they offer four hours of free valet parking. If you don’t mind paying for parking, Wynn’s three hours of free self-parking is a better deal.

Second, you need to consider how much time you plan on spending at the casino. If you only plan on spending a couple of hours there, MGM’s free valet parking might be a better deal since it’s good for up to four hours. However, if you plan on staying at the casino all day or all night, Wynn’s three hours of free self-parking will be a better deal.

So, which casino has the best free parking this summer? It depends on what’s important to you. If you want free valet parking, MGM is your best bet. If you want free self-parking, Wynn is your best bet.
