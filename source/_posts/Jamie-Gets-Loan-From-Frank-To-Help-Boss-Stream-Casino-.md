#  Jamie Shows His Bluebloods In A Big Way 

Jamie Shows His Bluebloods In A Big Way
In a game in which Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, played his usual role of high-stakes poker champion and won big, he also made a statement about his blue-blood pedigree.

The fact that Dimon is the descendant of Jewish immigrants who fled persecution in Ukraine and Romania probably doesn’t matter to many people. But, it is interesting to note that Jamie Dimon comes from humble beginnings and has accomplished a great deal in his life.

This was evident on Saturday night when he won nearly $1.5 million playing poker at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. This is just one more example of Jamie Dimon’s impressive track record as a businessman and investor.

But what may be even more impressive than his business acumen is Dimon’s willingness to stand up for what he believes in, no matter what the consequences may be. For example, after the financial crisis of 2008, Dimon was one of the few CEOs who spoke out against excessive regulation of the banking industry.

Many people have argued that this type of regulation was necessary in order to prevent another financial crisis from happening. However, Dimon believed that over-regulation would only cripple our economy and make it more difficult for businesses to grow and create jobs.

Even though he faced a lot of criticism for taking this stance, Dimon never backed down. He knew that he was doing what was best for our country and its economy, despite what others may have thought.

This type of courage and conviction is something that we could use more of in today’s society. Too often, we are quick to criticize others without understanding their perspectives or motivations.

Jamie Dimon is a prime example of somebody who doesn’t let his critics get him down. He knows what he stands for and isn’t afraid to fight for what he believes in, no matter who or what is opposing him.

#  Jamie Gets Financial Assistance From Frank To Help Boss Stream Casino 

Jamie, the young, aspiring boss of a casino streaming operation was in need of some financial assistance. Frank, a fellow casino streamer and acquaintance of Jamie's proposed to help him out. 

Frank had been in the same position not too long ago and was more than happy to help a fellow casino streamer in need. He agreed to give Jamie $1,000 to help get his streaming operation up and running.

Jamie was grateful for Frank's help and promised to pay him back as soon as he could. With the extra money, Jamie was able to buy better quality streaming gear and improve his production quality overall.

The two continued to work together and even became friends in the process. Streaming casino games together became a fun pastime for the both of them.

#  Jamie Comes Up Big When It Matters Most 

Jamie Collins has always been a player that comes up big in the clutch. This was never more evident than in the AFC Championship game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Collins had an interception early in the game that set the tone for the Patriots defense. He also had six tackles, including one for a loss, and a quarterback hit.

But it was his strip-sack of Ben Roethlisberger in the fourth quarter that turned the tide of the game. The Steelers were driving downfield looking to take the lead when Collins made his big play.

This was just the latest example of Collins coming through when his team needed him most. He has a knack for making big plays in critical moments.

Collins is entering free agency this offseason and is sure to get plenty of offers from other teams. The Patriots should do whatever they can to re-sign him, because he is a difference-maker who can make a huge impact on their Super Bowl chances.
