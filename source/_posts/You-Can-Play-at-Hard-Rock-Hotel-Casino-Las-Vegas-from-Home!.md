#  How Far is Hard Rock Hotel Casino by Venetian?

The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Hard Rock Hotel Casino are two of the most popular hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. If you're trying to figure out how far one is from the other, it's not quite as simple as looking at a map. The Venetian is located in the middle of the Strip, while the Hard Rock is on the northern end.

The Venetian is about 1.5 miles from the Hard Rock, so it would take about 20 minutes to walk there. If you're in a hurry, you could take a taxi, which should cost around $10-12. You could also take the Monorail, which runs from the MGM Grand to the Sahara casino. It costs $5 per ride or $12 for an all-day pass.

If you're looking for something a little more exciting than just walking or taking a taxi, you could always hop on a zip line. A trip down the zip line will set you back $28, but it's definitely a unique way to get between these two hotels.
